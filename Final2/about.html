<h2> About Me</h2>

<p class="er">Hi, I am Kaleb Rheed Stock! I am currently a freshman at Illinois State University majoring in Creative Technology : Game Design. As of right now I am taking a web-design class. Which is where I learned to develop this page. I am looking forward to future years in college. Finding a job hopefully and with this page, I can put all my work in one place.</p>

  <h2> About my page </h2>

<p class="er"> With this page I can take the next years of college and collect all my work I create and store it here. Everything is in one place that can be shown in a full resume, and this is only the start. I will also be including other work I do outside of schooling. To have a full library of work I feel will help aid in resume work.</p>
